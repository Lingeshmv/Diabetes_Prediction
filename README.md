# Diabetes-predection

## Diabetes predection :

 Diabetes prediction refers to the process of using various data, such as medical records, demographic information, lifestyle factors, and genetic predispositions, to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes in the future. Machine learning techniques are commonly used for diabetes prediction. These techniques involve training a model on historical data of individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes or have risk factors for diabetes, and then using this trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

 ## About Dataset:

  To train a model, we need data. One popular dataset of diabetes predection is available in this repo.
- Age: The age of the individual.
- Body Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- Blood Pressure: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements.
- Glucose Level: Fasting blood glucose concentration or oral glucose tolerance test results.
- Insulin Level: Fasting serum insulin levels. 
- etc

## Machine Learning Models used:

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Linear Regression

## Procedure : 

Importing libraries : First we need to import the required libraries using IMPORT function to use there functionalities.

Data Collection: Collecting relevant data such as medical records, lab results, lifestyle factors, and other demographic information.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the collected data, which may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing and val sets.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Selecting relevant features (variables) that are likely to be predictive of diabetes or engineering new features based on domain knowledge.

Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning model for diabetes prediction. Commonly used models include decision trees, random forests.

Model Training: Training the selected model on the training data. During training, the model learns patterns and relationships in the data that help it make predictions.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data to determine the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes.

Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model into production to make real-time predictions or support clinical decision-making.
